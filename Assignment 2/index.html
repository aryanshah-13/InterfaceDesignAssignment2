    <h1>Lyrics of song: Let me love you by Justin Beiber</h1>
    <p>I used to believe<br>
        <span id="burning">We were burning on the edge of something beautiful</span> <br>
        Something beautiful <br>
        Selling a dream <br>
        Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle !!! <br>
        On a miracle !!!!! <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span id="dark">Say, go through the darkest of days</span><br>
        Heaven's a heartbreak away<br>
        Never let you go, never let me down<br>
        <span id="hell">Oh, it's been a hell of a ride</span><br>
        Driving the edge of a knife<br>
        <span class="yell">Never let you go, never let me down !!!</span><br>
    </p>

        Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah<br>
        I won't give up, nah-nah-nah<br>

    </p>
        
    <p>
        Don't fall asleep <br>
        At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us<br>
        Miles ahead of us<br>
        All that we need<br>
        Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough (yeah)<br>
        Know we're good enough<br>
